# Math Tutoring App - Production Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ Local development working with all content (Sections 3-5)
✅ All features implemented and tested
✅ Code cleaned up and deployment-ready

## Critical Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Configuration (ALREADY DONE)
- Frontend `.env`: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://fahhemni-backend.onrender.com`
- Backend `.env`: `MONGO_URL` configured for production MongoDB

### 2. Force New Deployment
The issue you're experiencing is likely due to deployment caching. Follow these steps:

#### Option A: Force Redeploy on Emergent Platform
1. Go to your Emergent dashboard
2. Navigate to your app deployment settings
3. Look for "Force Redeploy" or "Clear Cache" option
4. Trigger a fresh deployment

#### Option B: GitHub Deployment Refresh
1. Make a small commit to force refresh:
   ```bash
   # Add a comment or space to any file
   git add .
   git commit -m "Force deployment refresh - latest content"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Check your deployment platform for new build

### 3. Verify Deployment URL
Ensure your deployed app is accessing the correct backend:
- Frontend should call: `https://fahhemni-backend.onrender.com/api/*`
- Check browser network tab to confirm API calls

### 4. Backend Verification
Ensure your backend at `https://fahhemni-backend.onrender.com` is:
1. Running and accessible
2. Has the latest database content
3. Properly configured with production MongoDB

## Expected Results After Deployment
- All 5 sections should show updated content
- Navigation fixes should work (no loops)
- Mobile UI should be responsive
- Login should work without 502 errors
- Bidirectional inequality validation should work

## Troubleshooting
If the issue persists:
1. Check deployment logs for errors
2. Verify backend is responding: `https://fahhemni-backend.onrender.com/api/health`
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Check if there's a CDN cache that needs clearing
