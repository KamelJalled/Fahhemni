# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Investigated Section 2 navigation 'bug' from practice2_2 to assessment2. Backend testing revealed this is NOT a bug - the system is working correctly. Assessment2 requires BOTH practice2_1 AND practice2_2 to be completed before access is granted. User experienced 403 error because they completed practice2_2 but skipped practice2_1. Stage access control properly enforces educational progression. No fixes needed - recommend improving UI clarity about practice stage requirements."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Backend testing confirmed assessment2 access control properly requires BOTH practice2_1 AND practice2_2 to be completed before assessment2 becomes accessible. ROOT CAUSE: User 'Sami' completed practice2_2 but skipped practice2_1, triggering 403 Forbidden error with message 'You must complete all practice stages first. Incomplete: practice2_1'. SYSTEM BEHAVIOR: Correctly enforces educational progression: prep2 → explanation2 → practice2_1 → practice2_2 → assessment2 → examprep2. RECOMMENDATION: No fixes needed - stage access control logic is working as designed to ensure proper learning sequence. Consider adding clearer UI indicators to show which practice stages are required for assessment access."

FIXED by updating to http://localhost:8001. However, the application requires authentication to access explanation stage, and the routing system redirects unauthenticated users to the welcome screen. TESTING RESULTS: ❌ Unable to test the 3 specific bugs (Virtual Keyboard, Example 2 instruction, Validation) due to authentication/routing issues preventing access to explanation stage. The backend API is functional (confirmed via curl), but frontend authentication flow needs to be resolved for proper testing.

Students can skip essential learning steps, which matches exactly the critical bug described in the review request where 'First example (simple inequality) must require 2 steps instead of accepting 1 step'.
