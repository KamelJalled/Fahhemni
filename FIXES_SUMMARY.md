3. Remove all Vercel references completely

## ✅ Issues RESOLVED:

### 1. Backend Connectivity Fixed
**Problem**: Frontend was pointing to old development URL
**Solution**: 
- Updated `frontend/.env` from `https://mathsolution-hub.preview.emergentagent.com` to `http://localhost:8001`
- Rebuilt frontend with correct configuration
- Verified backend API is working (tested all endpoints)

### 2. Vercel References Completely Removed
**Files Updated/Fixed:**

#### Environment Files:
- ✅ `frontend/.env` → Now points to localhost for development
- ✅ `frontend/.env.production` → Updated with production template (removed Vercel URL)

#### Documentation Files:
- ✅ `GITHUB_PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.md` → Replaced Vercel with Firebase Hosting
- ✅ `PUSH_TO_FAHHEMNI.md` → Removed Vercel deployment option
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` → Updated with generic deployment options

#### Removed References:
- ❌ `https://your-vercel-project.vercel.app` → Removed from all files
- ❌ Vercel deployment scripts → Removed
- ❌ Vercel-specific configurations → Cleaned up

### 3. Production Build Updated
**Actions Taken:**

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub**: All files are now ready
2. **Deploy Backend**: Use Railway, Render, or preferred Python hosting
3. **Deploy Frontend**: Upload build folder to Hostinger
4. **Update Backend URL**: In frontend config and rebuild if needed
5. **Test**: Verify login and functionality work
