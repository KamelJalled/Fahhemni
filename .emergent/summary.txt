The previous AI engineer initiated an iterative development process for a Grade 9 math tutoring app. Key phases included establishing an MVP, refactoring for generic deployment (removing Vercel dependencies), and addressing numerous bug reports. Significant work involved mobile optimization (responsive design, touch targets, keyboard positioning), and resolving recurring critical issues related to the backend URL configuration in the frontend  file, which inexplicably reverted multiple times.

Subsequently, the engineer focused on core functional bugs such as voice input reliability, Math Keyboard integration across stages, section duplication, and most critically, answer validation. The Class Assignment Bug was disproven on the backend, pointing to a frontend display issue. Extensive modifications were made to  to standardize input, implement individual step checks, and enhance feedback. The trajectory concludes with the discovery of a critical  in the  function, indicating an infinite recursion loop, which is currently blocking further progress on validation.

<product_requirements>
The Math Tutoring App aims to teach Grade 9 Saudi students inequalities. Initially, it featured 30 problems across 5 sections (One-Step Inequalities), with bilingual (Arabic/English) support, student/teacher logins, multi-step input, progressive Socratic hints, and progress tracking, using FastAPI/MongoDB.

**Key enhancements and bug fixes include:**
*   **Mobile Optimization:** Responsive design, thumb-friendly buttons, math keyboard positioning, scrollable section tabs, auto-scroll on input focus, voice input permissions on mobile.
*   **Input Features:** Voice input (Arabic/English speech-to-math, improved recognition, longer timeout), Mathematical Symbol Keyboard (visual toolbar for symbols, numerals, actions).
*   **Class Management:** Student class selection (GR9-A, B, C, D), teacher dashboard filtering.
*   **User Experience:** Welcome screen, end-of-section/demo messages, loading indicators, Start Over button, extended feedback timings for correct/wrong answers.
*   **Core Bug Fixes:** Persistent login, dashboard display, section navigation, class assignment, database issues, text-to-math conversion.
*   **Critical Blocking Bugs (latest):** Correct answer validation for all 30 problems, page refresh 404 errors, Submit Final Answer button functionality in Preparation stage, keyboard not working in Explanation/Assessment/Exam Prep stages, voice input not inserting text.

**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

*   ****: Main React component for routing and authentication context.
    *   **Changes**: Added catch-all route for better error handling on refresh,  uses  for state persistence.
*   ****: Displays problem sections and progress.
    *   **Changes**: Refactored to fetch and display sections dynamically, implemented stable React keys for rendering, added Start Over button, and addressed mobile horizontal scrolling.
*   ****: Core learning interface.
    *   **Importance**: Handles problem display, user input, hints, validation, and progression.
    *   **Changes**: Extensively modified for multi-step inputs, hints, integration of  and . Latest changes include fixing  to use , enhancing  for inequalities, adding individual Check Step buttons, implementing completion messages for stages, extending feedback timings, enabling keyboard/voice input for *all* stages by adjusting conditional rendering, and standardizing input logic for Preparation stage.
*   ****: Handles student authentication and class selection.
    *   **Changes**: Added a welcome screen with demo instructions before login, fixed Arabic translation error, resolved button clickability issues via z-index adjustment, removed debug banner.
*   ****: Implements Web Speech API.
    *   **Changes**: Improved microphone permissions for mobile, enhanced text-to-math conversion (e.g., x plus eight to x + 8, Arabic 'أصغر من أو يساوي' to '≤'), increased timeout to 15 seconds, fixed system hang on second use by improving  cleanup.
*   ****: Provides a visual on-screen keyboard.
    *   **Changes**: Fixed Arabic mode to show 'س' and 'ص' instead of 'x' and 'y', improved layout for Action tab overflow, ensured numeral toggle functionality.
*   ****: Displays debugging information.
    *   **Changes**: Modified to hide in production environments ().
*   ****: Critical for frontend environment variables.
    *   **Changes**: Repeatedly updated to  due to persistent reversion issues, then verified by restarting frontend server.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Answer Validation Fix:** Resolve the infinite recursion in  to correctly process and validate user input.
-   **Preparation Stage Completion:** Ensure status updates to Completed and shows Continue to Explanation Stage after correct answer.
-   **Explanation Stage Redesign:** Implement horizontal layout (3 examples side-by-side), single input field per example, clear visual/audio feedback, move input box up, ensure voice input inserts text.
-   **Page Refresh Bug:** Address 404 errors on refresh, ensuring state persistence or graceful redirection.
-   **Navigation Improvements:** Add Previous Stage button, ensure Continue to Next Stage only appears after all problems in a stage are complete, fix blank screen after Exam Prep.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of fixing a critical bug in the  component, specifically related to the answer validation logic for the Preparation stage. Following user feedback that answer validation was broken (not showing correct/wrong feedback), the engineer debugged the  function. The immediate discovery, as confirmed by console logs in Chat Message 614, is a . This indicates an infinite recursion loop within the  function, causing the validation process to crash before any feedback can be displayed to the user. This bug is blocking further progress on accurately validating student answers and providing instructional feedback. The last action was observing this critical error after rebuilding the frontend with added debugging. 
Critical Issue: Answer validation was working in early versions but keeps breaking with each iteration due to regression - new fixes overwrite working code without proper testing.

</current_work>
<optional_next_step>
The immediate next step is to fix the  by correcting the infinite recursion within the  function in .
CRITICAL: The normalizeAnswer function has infinite recursion causing stack overflow. 
Fix this FIRST before any other changes:
1. Find and fix the recursion in normalizeAnswer
2. Test that answer validation works
3. Only then proceed with other fixes

DO NOT remove or break existing working features while fixing new ones.
