The AI engineer has progressively developed a Grade 9 math tutoring app, moving from MVP to a sophisticated Socratic learning model. Initial efforts focused on fixing a critical  in  within , successfully resolving it through refactoring. Subsequent iterations addressed mobile optimization, input methods (voice, math keyboard), and crucial UI/UX improvements. A major focus was implementing a dual interaction model: step-by-step guidance for learning stages (Explanation, Practice) and final answer validation for testing stages (Preparation, Assessment, Exam Prep). The explanation stage underwent multiple redesigns, from a cramped horizontal layout to a tabbed interface, with content expansion and container width adjustments. The most recent work involved a comprehensive cleanup of stage interfaces, refining feedback logic, and fixing a critical JSX compilation error in , which was the immediate task before this summary.

The Math Tutoring App, targeting Grade 9 Saudi students, focuses on teaching inequalities. It supports bilingual content (Arabic/English), student/teacher logins, multi-step input, Socratic hints, and progress tracking. Key requirements included mobile optimization (responsive design, touch targets, keyboard positioning, auto-scroll, voice input permissions), robust input features (improved voice recognition, mathematical keyboard), and effective class management. Core functionality involved fixing persistent login issues, dashboard display, and section navigation. Critical pedagogical requirements emerged:
1.  **Preparation Stage:** Final answer only, three-attempt rule with progressive auto-hints, Continue to Explanation navigation after correct answer or 3 failures. Remove hint boxes.
2.  **Explanation Stage:** Tabbed interface with comprehensive, structured content. For each example: display solution (Part A), then provide step-by-step student practice (Part B) with explicit instructions, no hints, and correct validation. Input fields should be empty.
3.  **Practice Stages:** Step-by-step guided solving, explicit instructions, no hints. Keep previous step answers visible.
4.  **Assessment & Exam Prep:** Final answer only, three-attempt rule with auto-hints and score penalties. Mandatory redirection to Explanation after 3 failures. Remove hint boxes.

**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

-   ****: This is the most extensively modified file, central to all student interaction.
    -   **Summary**: Handles problem display, user input, hints, validation, and progression across all stages.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   Refactored  to fix infinite recursion by introducing .
        -   Generalized input interface, voice input, and math keyboard for all stages (Preparation, Assessment, Exam Prep).
        -   Implemented a three-try progressive feedback system for the Preparation stage, removing old conflicting logic.
        -   Underwent multiple UI redesigns for the Explanation stage: initially horizontal layout, then a tabbed interface, and finally expanding the container width ( to ).
        -   Implemented dual interaction model:  helper,  (step-by-step), and  (final answer, redirection).
        -   Introduced , ,  states.
        -   Updated , , and  to reflect new stage logic, navigation, and state management.
        -   Refined Explanation stage practice: removed placeholders, fixed step instructions, improved validation, and step progression.
        -   Cleaned up UI by removing explicit Hints sections and Show Hint buttons across Preparation, Practice, Assessment, and Exam Prep.
        -   Fixed a critical JSX parsing error related to fragment tags.
-   ****: Manages problem data and content.
    -   **Summary**: Stores problem definitions, including solution steps and explanation content.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with comprehensive explanation content and specific step-by-step data for practice problems to support the Socratic tutoring model.
-   ****: Used for logging test outcomes and progress.
    -   **Summary**: Documents the results of automated and manual testing, crucial for tracking bug fixes and feature implementations.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to reflect the status of bug fixes (e.g.,  bug), new features, and user feedback.

<pending_tasks>
-   Verify the JSX compilation fix for .
-   Thoroughly test the Explanation stage validation to ensure it's working correctly with step-by-step input, explicit instructions, and progression.
-   Ensure that the Continue to Explanation button in the Preparation stage correctly navigates to the Explanation stage.
-   Verify score and hint penalty display in Assessment/Exam Prep stages.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on resolving a critical frontend compilation issue. After implementing a series of significant UI/UX changes and logical refactors, particularly within  to align with the Socratic AI Tutoring model (including dynamic stage-based interaction, progressive hints, and redesigned layouts), the application failed to compile. The user reported Compiled with problems:. Debugging logs identified a , specifically an  and , indicating an issue with mismatched JSX fragment tags within . The AI engineer identified and fixed this JSX structural issue. The immediate next action observed in the trajectory is restarting the frontend service to apply these JSX fixes. This compilation error was blocking any further testing or preview of the previously implemented features, making its resolution paramount.
