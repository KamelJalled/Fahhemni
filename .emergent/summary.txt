<analysis>
The AI engineer's work trajectory showcases an iterative development process for a Grade 9 math tutoring app. Initial efforts focused on establishing a full-stack MVP, covering frontend UI, backend API with MongoDB, and core features like problem-solving, hints, and progress tracking. A significant phase involved preparing the application for deployment, first targeting Vercel, then shifting to a generic GitHub push due to user requests, which required extensive refactoring to remove Vercel-specific configurations and ensure a correct production build with proper backend URL integration.

Subsequently, the engineer addressed multiple critical bug reports, including persistent login issues, dashboard display inaccuracies (localization and section visibility), and errors in core functionalities. The latest development cycle involved implementing advanced features such as voice input, a mathematical symbol keyboard, and class management, alongside resolving several complex bugs related to these new additions and existing features like class assignment logic and section navigation. The work concluded with the engineer rebuilding the frontend and backend after applying a batch of bug fixes, indicating that the verification and further refinement of these fixes are the immediate next steps.

<product_requirements>
The Math Tutoring App targets Grade 9 Saudi students for learning inequalities.
**Initial Core Features:**
*   **Content:** 30 problems, 5 sections (starting with One-Step Inequalities: Preparation, Explanation, Practice, Assessment, Exam Prep).
*   **Language:** Arabic/English, RTL support, accepts Western/Eastern Arabic numerals, 'x' or 'ุณ' variables.
*   **Users:** Student login (username) and Teacher dashboard (access code: teacher2024).
*   **Interaction:** Multi-step input, 3 progressive Socratic hints per step, Try Again, Next Problem, interactive practice, motivational elements.
*   **Progression/Scoring:** Student progress tracking, progression locks (flexible for Assessment), weighted scoring.
*   **Design:** Clean, modern, gamified, uses Shadcn UI, no direct instructions in problems.
*   **Data:** Initially , transitioned to FastAPI/MongoDB.

**Key Bug Fixes/Enhancements during development:** Removed answer from placeholder, fixed username null error on logout, stage status update bug, state reset, enhanced step validation, streamlined explanation stage, removed Vercel dependencies, fixed backend URL for deployment, addressed login/dashboard access issues.

**Latest Enhancements (Partially Implemented):**
*   **Bug Fixes (PART 1):** Status updating (Preparation/Explanation stages), logout error, step labels, stage navigation button.
*   **Content Expansion (PART 2):** 4 new sections with 6 problems each: Two-Step, Multi-Step, Variables on Both Sides, Compound Inequalities.
*   **Input Features (PART 3):** Voice input (microphone button, Arabic/English speech-to-math conversion, permissions, visual indicator) and Mathematical Symbol Keyboard (visual toolbar for symbols, operations, numerals, actions).
*   **Class Management (PART 4):** Class selection (GR9-A, B, C, D) for students, teacher dashboard filtering by class/section.
*   **Data Verification (PART 5):** Confirm MongoDB progress storage, admin endpoint to clear test data, ensure persistence.

**Latest Critical Bug Report (Post-MVP Features):**
*   **Voice Input Fixes:** Post-processing layer for text-to-math conversion, microphone permissions, Arabic vocabulary support.
*   **Section Navigation Fix:** Ensure only the active section is displayed.
*   **Class Assignment Bug:** Fix student class registration and teacher dashboard filtering.
*   **Math Keyboard Layout:** Fix spacing, alignment, symbol clickability, numeral toggle.
*   **Database Fixes:** Verify 30 problems, 5 sections, clear test data (string username entries).
Priority Issues for Immediate Fix:
1. Voice input converts x plus eight to text instead of x + 8
2. Section 1 content remains visible when clicking other sections
3. Students registering with classes B, C, D are all saved as GR9-A
4. Microphone turns off immediately without capturing speech
5. Math keyboard Eastern/Western numeral toggle not working

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with distinct  and  directories.



**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js:** Main React component for routing, global state, and authentication. Updated for login/logout and navigation logic, ensuring state reset.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js:** Displays problem sections and progress. Rewritten to fetch and display all 5 sections dynamically, update problem card statuses, and implement localization for stage labels.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/ProblemView.js:** Core learning interface. Heavily modified for multi-step inputs, hints, interactive practice, answer normalization, *and integration of VoiceInput and MathKeyboard components*.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/StudentLogin.js:** Handles student authentication. Updated to include class selection during registration, and improved error handling.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/TeacherDashboard.js:** Teacher analytics. Modified to include class filtering capabilities.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/TeacherLogin.js:** Teacher authentication. Improved error handling and updated navigation logic.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/VoiceInput.js (NEW):** Implements Web Speech API for voice-to-text, with a new post-processing layer for Arabic/English speech-to-math conversion. Includes microphone permissions and visual indicators.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/MathKeyboard.js (NEW):** Provides a visual on-screen keyboard for mathematical symbols and numerals, with improved layout and toggle functionality.
*   **/app/backend/server.py:** FastAPI entry point. Expanded with API endpoints for students/teachers, database init/shutdown. *Crucially updated for class management (student registration, teacher stats filtering), new admin endpoint to clear test data, and corrected authentication endpoint paths (, )*.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently focused on resolving several critical bugs reported by the user to finalize the MVP for classroom testing. This involves addressing issues across multiple features:
1.  **Voice Input:** Implementing a text-to-math converter for transcription, improving microphone permissions, and enhancing Arabic vocabulary support.
2.  **Section Navigation:** Correcting a bug where content from non-active sections remained visible.
3.  **Class Assignment:** Fixing the logic to ensure students are properly assigned to classes during registration and that the teacher dashboard accurately filters students by their registered class. This involved identifying and correcting a hardcoded section in the  function in  and ensuring the  field is correctly handled in the backend  model.
4.  **Math Keyboard Layout:** Adjusting button spacing, alignment, and ensuring all symbols are clickable, including the numeral toggle.

The engineer has applied a series of file edits across frontend components (, , , , , ) and backend files (, , ) to address these bugs. The last action performed in the trajectory was a command to rebuild the frontend after applying these fixes, indicating the next logical step would be to test these newly implemented changes comprehensively.
Current Deployment Status:
- Frontend: Successfully deployed at https://fahhemni.ai (Hostinger)
- Backend: Successfully deployed at https://fahhemni-backend.onrender.com
