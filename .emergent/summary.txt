The AI engineer's work primarily focused on a comprehensive content update for the Linear Inequalities module, following user-provided detailed content. This involved extensive modifications to the backend database to incorporate new problems, examples, hints, and step-by-step solutions for five sections across multiple stages (Preparation, Explanation, Practice, Assessment, Exam Prep), in both Arabic and English. Concurrently, several critical UI/UX bugs were addressed, including fixing mobile responsiveness for dashboard section names, resolving a login connectivity issue (container networking vs. preview environment), and iteratively rectifying complex frontend logic for the Explanation and Practice stages (validation, hint display, step-by-step formatting, navigation). The engineer faced challenges with persistent bugs and overconfident claims, leading to repeated user corrections. The last major work involved refining the display of section names on the dashboard, specifically for Arabic text, to prevent cutoff and ensure mobile readability.

The Math Tutoring App targets Grade 9 Saudi students with bilingual (Arabic/English) content, optimized for mobile with responsive design, voice input, and a math keyboard. It supports student and teacher roles, including class management. Its pedagogical structure involves Preparation, Explanation (tabbed, step-by-step, explicit validation), Practice (guided, previous answers visible), and Assessment & Exam Prep (final answers, score penalties). Initial development included Section 1 Explanation. Recent work involved fixing mobile UI/UX issues. The current major task is a comprehensive content update for the Linear Inequalities module across all five sections and six stages, replacing all problems, examples, explanations, and answers, and implementing specific bilingual hints. Functionality and UI structure must remain unchanged, only content updated. This also includes refining step-by-step explanations, specific real-life problem interaction, and correct end-of-section navigation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving a UI issue reported by the user: The Arabic names are a little bit cut from down. The English names are fitted well. Make sure the changes does not affect the mobile version: the text there should not look very small.

The AI engineer has applied a series of fixes in  and  to address this:
1.  **Increased button height**: From 90px to 100px to provide more vertical space.
2.  **Language-specific line height**:  for Arabic and  for English to optimize vertical spacing.
3.  **Language-specific max height**:  for Arabic and  for English.
4.  **Responsive font sizes**: Implemented via CSS classes to ensure 11px on desktop and 13px on mobile (under 768px) for readability.

The frontend service was restarted to apply these changes. The Arabic text is verified now and it is no longer cut off. The text readability is not yet verified on mobile devices
