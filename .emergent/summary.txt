<product_requirements>
The application is a math tutoring app for Grade 9 Saudi students learning inequalities.
**Core Features:**
*   **Problem Content:** 30 problems across 5 sections, initially focusing on Section 1: One-Step Inequalities. Specific problems for Preparation, Explanation, Practice (2), Assessment, and Exam Prep.
*   **Language Support:** Arabic/English bilingual with RTL for Arabic. Accepts Western (0-9) and Eastern Arabic (٠-٩) numerals, and x or س variables.
*   **User Types:** Student login (username only) and Teacher dashboard (access code: teacher2024).
*   **Learning Interaction:**
    *   Problem display with proper mathematical notation.
    *   Multi-step input fields for solving, accepting intermediate correct steps.
    *   3 progressive Socratic hints per step, hidden by default, revealed via Show Hint button. Hint usage tracked with score penalty.
    *   Try Again button to clear inputs without leaving the problem.
    *   Next Problem button after correct answers.
    *   Interactive Preparation and Explanation sections with Try It Yourself practice after each example.
    *   Motivational elements (points, badges, encouraging messages).
*   **Progression & Scoring:**
    *   Progress tracking per student.
    *   Progression locks: Practice before Assessment unlocks, Assessment before Exam Prep unlocks (flexible: Assessment can be attempted after one Practice problem with a warning).
    *   Weighted Scoring: Practice (15% each), Assessment (30%), Exam Prep (30%), Preparation (10%), Explanation (0%).
*   **Design:** Clean, modern, gamified for teenagers, progress bars, achievements. Adheres to specific UI/UX guidelines (Shadcn components, no direct instructions in problems, clear step labels, no dark gradients).
*   **Data Persistence:** Initially , transitioned to MongoDB via FastAPI backend.
*   **Key Bug Fixes/Enhancements:** Removed answer from placeholder, fixed username null error on logout, fixed stage status update bug, ensured complete state reset on navigation/logout, enhanced step validation logic to accept multiple correct answer forms, streamlined explanation stage by removing useless submission box.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development:** React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
-   **Frontend UI:** Shadcn UI components for modern interface, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Routing:** React Router DOM for SPA navigation.
-   **Backend API:** FastAPI with Pydantic for data models.
-   **Database ORM/ODM:** Motor (async MongoDB driver).
-   **Bilingual Support:** Dynamic language switching, RTL, numeral normalization.
-   **Deployment:** Vercel for serverless architecture.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured as a full-stack project with separate  and  directories, alongside project-level configuration and documentation files.



**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**

*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js:** The main React component, managing application-wide routing (using ), global state (like user authentication), and API communication. It was updated to handle login/logout, navigate between views (, , , ), and ensure a complete state reset on logout.
*   **/app/frontend/src/mock.js:** Initially provided placeholder data for problems and student progress. It was extensively updated to include complex structures for step-by-step solutions, multiple examples for interactive explanation problems, and detailed hint definitions, crucial for frontend-only development and later backend integration.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Dashboard.js:** Displays the list of problem sections and their completion status. Changes include fetching actual progress from the backend, implementing the flexible progression logic (allowing early access to Assessment), and dynamically updating problem card statuses (e.g., Start, In Progress, Completed).
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/ProblemView.js:** This is the core learning interface. It underwent significant modifications to:
    *   Render multi-step input fields for problem solving.
    *   Implement logic for displaying and tracking hidden, progressive hints per step.
    *   Handle Try Again and Next Problem button functionalities.
    *   Integrate with the backend for answer submission and step validation.
    *   Manage interactive practice for Preparation and Explanation examples.
    *   Normalize student answers to accept various operators and numeral systems.
    *   Display clear, non-spoiling step labels.
*   **/app/backend/server.py:** The FastAPI entry point. It was expanded from basic status checks to include a full suite of API endpoints for students (login, submit answer, get problems, get progress) and teachers (dashboard analytics). It also includes database initialization and shutdown logic, and crucial environment variable loading.
*   **/app/backend/models.py:** Defines the Pydantic models that shape the data for both the API requests/responses and the MongoDB schema (e.g., , , , ). The  model was significantly enhanced to store  for multi-step validation.
*   **/app/backend/utils.py:** Contains utility functions, notably , which was improved to handle different mathematical operators (, , , ) and both Western and Eastern Arabic numerals for robust answer validation.
*   **/app/contracts.md:** A documentation file outlining API endpoints, expected data structures, and the integration strategy between frontend and backend.
*   **/app/vercel.json, DEPLOYMENT.md, deploy.sh, backend/vercel_app.py, frontend/.env.production, .vercelignore:** A suite of files created to support Vercel deployment, including configuration, a detailed guide, and helper scripts for automated setup.
*   **/app/README.md, setup-github.sh:** Files created or updated to prepare the project for a GitHub repository, including project overview and a script for Git initialization.

<current_work>
The AI engineer's immediate focus is on the final preparations for deployment and version control. The user explicitly requested to push all the actual code files to GitHub. To facilitate this, the engineer has already created a comprehensive set of deployment-related files for Vercel (e.g., , , ) and GitHub setup scripts (, updated ).

The very last action in the trajectory indicates that the engineer is currently in the process of refining the file list for the GitHub push, ensuring that only essential application files are included and large, unnecessary directories like  are excluded. This step is crucial for maintaining a clean and manageable repository. All major development, feature implementation, and critical bug fixes have been claimed as successfully completed, making the application a solidified MVP ready for production deployment.
