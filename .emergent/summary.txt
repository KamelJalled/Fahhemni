The AI engineer's work primarily revolved around refining a Grade 9 math tutoring app, specifically focusing on the Explanation stage and addressing several critical bugs. Initially, the AI engineer addressed a hardcoded navigation flow, placeholder retention, incorrect step instructions, and broken validation logic within . This involved adding new state variables, refactoring input and validation handlers, and integrating voice/math keyboard for explanation steps. A significant challenge was an authentication redirect preventing access to the , which was resolved by a proper login flow. Later, the work focused on correcting mathematical validation discrepancies in  and , ensuring inequality sign flips were correctly handled. The most recent efforts targeted persistent issues with the virtual keyboard, error handling, and completion navigation in the Explanation stage, along with quick fixes for a Practice stage instruction, logout error screen, and clearing student data via a new backend endpoint.

<product_requirements>
The Math Tutoring App, designed for Grade 9 Saudi students, teaches inequalities with bilingual (Arabic/English) support and student/teacher roles. Key features include mobile optimization (responsive design, voice input, math keyboard) and class management. Pedagogical requirements are:
1.  **Preparation Stage:** Final answer only, three attempts with progressive auto-hints, Continue to Explanation after correct answer or three failures. No hint boxes.
2.  **Explanation Stage:** Tabbed interface with structured content. Each example has a solution (Part A) and step-by-step student practice (Part B) with explicit instructions, no hints, empty input fields, and correct validation.
3.  **Practice Stages:** Step-by-step guided solving, explicit instructions, no hints, with previous step answers visible.
4.  **Assessment & Exam Prep:** Final answer only, three attempts with auto-hints and score penalties. Mandatory redirection to Explanation after three failures. No hint boxes.

    -   **Summary**: Central to student interaction, displaying problems, handling input, hints, validation, and stage progression.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications to support the Socratic model, including refactoring  (pre-trajectory), generalizing input, implementing dual interaction models (, ). Crucially, the trajectory shows:
        -   Addition of ,  states to fix placeholder retention.
        -   Refined  for accurate stage navigation.
        -   Updated step instructions and validation logic for Explanation stage examples (e.g., x + 4 ≤ 9 -> x ≤ 5, then -3x ≤ 12 -> x ≥ -4).
        -   Integrated voice and math keyboard input handlers for new explanation stage state variables.
        -   Added debugging styling (blue border) to input fields.
        -   Attempted to fix virtual keyboard insertion logic by using .
        -   Added backend submission and status update logic for explanation stage completion.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Stores problem definitions and solution steps.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with specific explanation content and step-by-step data for practice problems. The trajectory included:
        -   Correction of Example 1 and Example 2 step instructions and expected answers ().
        -   Correction of Example 3's problem and expected answer to ensure correct inequality flipping.
        -   Fix for practice stage's Step 2 instruction from Simplify the right side to Simplify both sides.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: FastAPI backend for API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: A new admin endpoint  was added to clear all student and progress data, for testing purposes.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Main application component handling routing and global authentication context.
    -   **Changes**: Modified the logout handling to prevent a momentary error screen from appearing before redirecting to the login page.
-   ****
    -   **Summary**: Documents testing outcomes and progress.
    -   **Changes**: Continuously updated to reflect the status of bug fixes, including validation, instruction corrections, and keyboard issues, indicating the test agent's findings and subsequent manual verification.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Virtual Keyboard Broken in Explanation Stage:**The virtual keyboard opens and shows symbols, but text insertion into the answer fields is still not functional. This requires a thorough fix to ensure the keyboard handling logic correctly targets the active input field for each of the three examples.
-   **Error Handling Not Working (Explanation Examples 1, 2 & 3):** When incorrect answers are entered, there is no corrective message or error notification (e.g., Not quite. Try again) being displayed. This critical feedback loop is currently missing and needs to be implemented.
-   **Navigation After Completing All 3 Examples:** the explanation stage's completion status is not updated.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer addressed a series of quick fixes requested by the user. These included:
1.  **Correcting a Practice Stage Instruction:** The Step 2 instruction in  was changed from Simplify the right side to Simplify both sides.
2.  **Fixing Logout Error Screen:** The  file was modified to prevent a momentary error screen flash upon logout, ensuring a direct transition to the login screen.
3.  **Deleting All Student Records:** A new admin API endpoint, , was implemented in  and subsequently invoked to clear all student and progress data from the MongoDB database.
4.  **Clearing Teacher Dashboard History:** This was implicitly addressed by clearing student records, as the dashboard relies on this data, and verified by restarting services.

These quick fixes were confirmed as working through manual screenshots, ensuring a smoother user experience and clean data for further testing. However, prior to these quick fixes, the AI engineer was still grappling with persistent critical bugs in the Explanation stage, specifically the virtual keyboard's inability to insert text into input fields and verifying error handling.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to address the remaining critical bugs in the Explanation stage, starting with fixing the virtual keyboard, then fixing the error handling in the 3 examples of the explanation stage.
