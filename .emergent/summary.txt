The previous AI engineer focused on refining Section 2 of the Math Tutoring App. Initial work addressed two critical user-reported issues: progressive hint implementation for word problems and correct three-step progression for all word problems. The AI first updated backend  with user-specified Socratic hints and correct step definitions for Ticket Sales and Candy Distribution problems. Concurrently,  was modified to leverage these backend hints, especially after an initial claim of hint implementation was refuted by the user. The  function was a key architectural fix to ensure practice stage word problems received hints. The stage access control () was also clarified, confirming that navigation to assessment stages is intentionally blocked until all prerequisite practice stages are complete. Extensive backend and frontend testing agents were utilized to validate each fix, including database resets. The trajectory concluded with successful verification of the progressive hint system and the frontend login flow.

The Math Tutoring App, designed for Grade 9 Saudi students, offers bilingual (Arabic/English) content with responsive mobile design. Its pedagogical model includes Preparation, Explanation, Practice, Assessment, and Exam Prep stages. The core task involved updating content for Section 2 (Solving Inequalities by Multiplication or Division) across all stages, including new problems, bilingual hints, and step-by-step solutions, while maintaining existing functionality.

Key bug fixes for Section 2 included:
1.  **Word Problem Hints**: Hints must *never* reveal the inequality directly, but progressively guide students using Socratic questions about variables, relationships, and inequality symbols (e.g., at least implies â‰¥).
2.  **Step Count Enforcement**: Word problems *must* require 3 distinct steps (Write Inequality, Perform Operation, Simplify) for practice stages. For Assessment/Exam Prep, the 3-step mental process is required, but only the final simplified answer is accepted.
3.  **Navigation**: Ensure correct stage progression, particularly from practice to assessment, understanding that assessment stages are locked until all practice stages are complete.
4.  **Existing Functionality**: Overall structure and solving methodology from Section 1 were to be applied to all sections.

-   ****: Controls the display and navigation of math sections on the student dashboard. No direct modifications mentioned in this trajectory.
-   ****: Critical file managing student interaction, input, validation, hints, and stage progression.
    -   **Hint System Fixes**: Modified hint display logic in preparation and assessment stages to directly use / from the backend, replacing generic  and  calls (Chat Message 45, 51).
    -   **Stage Type Routing**: Corrected  function to ensure word problems in practice stages are properly routed to hint-enabled logic, addressing a bug where they were routed to step-by-step solving without hints (Chat Message 131).
    -   **Step Count Enforcement**: Updated  to ensure Assessment and Exam Prep stages correctly enforce 3 steps for word problems (Chat Message 72).
    -   **Stage Access Control**: Contains  which was clarified to enforce completion of all practice stages before accessing assessment stages (Chat Message 110).
-   ****: Contains global CSS styles for the frontend application. No direct modifications related to the trajectory.
-   ****: Houses the backend logic for initializing and structuring math problems and curriculum content.
    -   **Word Problem Hint Update**: Updated  and  for  (Ticket Sales) and  (Candy Distribution) problems to include the user-specified progressive, Socratic hints (Chat Message 31, 33).
    -   **Step Solution Update**: Corrected  for  to accurately define 3 distinct steps for word problems, ensuring step 2 is the operation and step 3 is the final simplification (Chat Message 76).
    -   **Exam Prep Step Definition**: Added  for  to explicitly define its 3-step structure, even if only the final answer is accepted (Chat Message 82).
-   ****: FastAPI backend, handles API routes and business logic. Utilized  for database reinitialization (Chat Message 53, 84). No direct code modifications mentioned in the trajectory for  related to the fixes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical user report that progressive hints for Section 2 word problems were not implemented, despite prior claims. After re-verifying backend hint data in  (which was correct), a frontend testing agent  identified the root cause: an architectural bug in  where the  function incorrectly routed practice stages to a step-by-step solving mode without hints, instead of the intended hint-enabled logic. The AI modified  to correctly route word problems in practice stages to receive progressive hints. This fix was thoroughly tested using , confirming that hints now display progressively in both English and Arabic. The last action was a comprehensive verification of the hints flow after login.
