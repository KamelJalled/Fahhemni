The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Math Tutoring App, starting with initial bug fixes and content implementation for Sections 3-5 (Multi-Step, Compound, and Absolute Value Inequalities). Key tasks included addressing a navigation loop in the explanation stage, implementing bidirectional inequality validation, and resolving mobile UI issues (section scrolling, off-screen logout button). The engineer successfully implemented these fixes by modifying  and . Later, the focus shifted to deployment preparation, involving env file verification and cleanup of . A significant hurdle emerged when the user reported deployment issues (Login failed: 502) and unpushed content. The engineer systematically debugged these, identifying and correcting  file inconsistencies (frontend  and backend ) that caused local login failures and prevented proper API communication. The trajectory concludes with the engineer verifying all content and fixes are committed, and providing instructions for production deployment.

<product_requirements>
The Math Tutoring App, targeting Grade 9 Saudi students, offers bilingual (Arabic/English) content through Preparation, Explanation, Practice, Assessment, and Exam Prep stages. The app aims to provide an interactive learning experience for inequalities.

**Implemented features & fixes:**
1.  **Section 2 Fixes:** Previous work included resolving inequality sign flipping, dynamic UI, Arabic hint inversion, and progress tracking.
2.  **Section 3 (Multi-Step Inequalities):** Detailed content for  type problems, including distributive property and 2-3 step solutions.
3.  **Section 4 (Compound Inequalities):** Content for  and  inequalities, with complex hint logic.
4.  **Section 5 (Absolute Value Inequalities):** Content for  type problems, covering conversion to compound/disjoint inequalities.
5.  **Absolute Value Input Enhancements:** Added  to keyboard,  support, and visual hints.
6.  **Navigation Fixes:** Resolved loops in the explanation stage and ensured smooth stage transitions.
7.  **Bidirectional Expression Validation:** Accepted reversed inequality formats (e.g., 250 â‰¥ 100 + 2k).
8.  **Mobile UI Improvements:** Implemented a mobile dropdown for section selection and fixed horizontal overflow, making the logout button accessible.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in troubleshooting deployment and login issues reported by the user. The user stated Not solved regarding content and login post-deployment preparation.

The engineer identified that the   had been reverted to a preview URL, causing login failures (502 Bad Gateway) when the frontend tried to connect to an unavailable backend. Additionally, the   was incorrectly set to a placeholder production URL, preventing the backend from starting locally.

The following actions were taken:
1.  **Frontend URL Correction**: Changed   from  to .
2.  **Backend MongoDB URL Correction**: Changed   from  back to .
3.  **Service Restarts**: Restarted both backend and frontend services to apply environment variable changes.
4.  **Verification**: Successfully tested backend API endpoints (e.g., , ) to confirm database content and functionality. Verified Sections 3, 4, and 5 content were correctly served.
5.  **Commit**: All these fixes and the content updates were ensured to be committed to the local Git repository.

The current state is that the application is functional in the local development environment, with all previously implemented features (content for Sections 3-5, navigation fixes, bidirectional validation, mobile UI improvements) and the recent  corrections verified. The login issue (502 error) is still not resolved for the local setup. The persistent problem is a deployment/infrastructure issue related to the production  not being correctly picked up or the external backend itself not responding.
