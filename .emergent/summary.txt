The AI engineer's work involved an initial content update for Section 2, Solving Inequalities by Multiplication or Division, across all stages in English and Arabic. Following this, the user reported six critical bug prompts for Section 2. The AI systematically addressed these: fixing navigation flows, implementing dynamic progress tracking, enhancing mathematical validation (including sign flipping and multiple answer formats), enforcing correct step progression for various problem types, correcting word problem displays, and overhauling the hint system to provide guidance without direct answers. A critical security bug allowing stage skipping was fixed with comprehensive frontend and backend access control. A UI layout issue was also addressed. Throughout, the AI utilized backend and frontend testing agents, and an admin database reset was crucial for applying some content changes. The trajectory concluded with the AI confirming the login functionality after a user-reported issue.

The Math Tutoring App, targeting Grade 9 Saudi students, offers bilingual (Arabic/English) content, optimized for mobile with responsive design. Its pedagogical structure includes Preparation, Explanation (tabbed, step-by-step, explicit validation), Practice (guided, previous answers visible), and Assessment & Exam Prep (final answers, score penalties). Initial development included Section 1 Explanation.

The current major task involved a comprehensive content update for Linear Inequalities module, specifically Section 2 (Solving Inequalities by Multiplication or Division). This required replacing all problems, examples, explanations, and answers for Preparation, Explanation (3 levels), Practice (classic/real-life), Assessment, and Exam Prep stages, with specific bilingual hints. Functionality and UI structure must remain unchanged, only content updated.

Subsequent user feedback led to critical bug fixes for Section 2: correcting stage navigation and dashboard context, ensuring progress tracking updates, implementing robust mathematical validation for inequality operations (including sign flipping), enforcing specific step counts for different problem types, fixing word problem display, implementing critical stage access control to prevent cheating, refining UI layout spacing, and overhauling the hint system to provide guidance instead of direct answers. The overall structure and solving methodology from Section 1 were to be applied to all sections (2-5).

<pending_tasks>
- **Comprehensive Content Update (Sections 3-5)**: Update all remaining sections with curriculum content, ensuring all stages and bilingual aspects are correctly implemented following the Section 1 and 2 structure and methodology.
These fixes apply to ALL SECTIONS in the MVP, not just Section 2. The Socratic method principle means:
NEVER give direct answers
ALWAYS guide the student to discover the solution
REQUIRE proper step-by-step progression
LOCK advanced stages until prerequisites are complete

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a user report regarding the login screen not allowing student or teacher access to the app. The AI conducted a thorough investigation, including manually testing student and teacher login flows via API calls and utilizing a frontend testing agent.

The investigation concluded that there was **no authentication bug**. Both the student and teacher login systems were found to be fully functional, with backend APIs returning proper 200 responses for valid credentials and the frontend correctly redirecting to the respective dashboards. The teacher login was verified to correctly require an . The frontend testing agent confirmed 100% functionality for both login flows, including error handling for invalid credentials. The AI determined the user's report was either based on a previously resolved issue, user error (incorrect credentials), or a temporary client-side problem. This final verification confirmed the stability of the core authentication mechanism.
