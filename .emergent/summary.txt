The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Math Tutoring App, primarily focusing on content implementation and persistent deployment/environment configuration issues. Initially, the engineer successfully implemented content for Sections 3-5 and various UI/logic fixes (e.g., navigation loops, bidirectional inequality validation, mobile UI adjustments). A major recurring problem was the inconsistent management of  variables between local development and production deployment, leading to a chicken-and-egg situation where changing variables for one environment broke the other. The user consistently reported deployment failures (old version active) and local preview regressions. After multiple attempts and a call to a , the root cause for deployment was identified as likely browser/CDN caching, while local environment  files were correctly separated and restored. The login endpoint was also clarified to be .

<product_requirements>
The Math Tutoring App, designed for Grade 9 Saudi students, provides bilingual (Arabic/English) content across Preparation, Explanation, Practice, Assessment, and Exam Prep stages. It focuses on interactive learning for inequalities.

**Implemented features & fixes:**
1.  **Section 2 Fixes:** Previous work included resolving inequality sign flipping, dynamic UI, Arabic hint inversion, and progress tracking.
2.  **Section 3 (Multi-Step Inequalities):** Detailed content for  type problems, including distributive property.
3.  **Section 4 (Compound Inequalities):** Content for  and  inequalities, with complex hint logic.
4.  **Section 5 (Absolute Value Inequalities):** Content for  type problems, covering conversion to compound/disjoint inequalities.
5.  **Absolute Value Input Enhancements:** Added  to the math keyboard and supported  notation with visual hints.
6.  **Navigation Fixes:** Resolved loops in the explanation stage and ensured smooth stage transitions.
7.  **Bidirectional Expression Validation:** Accepted reversed inequality formats (e.g., 250 â‰¥ 100 + 2k).
8.  **Mobile UI Improvements:** Implemented a mobile dropdown for section selection and fixed horizontal overflow, making the logout button accessible.
9.  **Local Environment Stability**: Ensured local login and content display are functional despite deployment-related  configuration changes.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical deployment issue where the user reported that new code versions were not being deployed to production, and the local preview had become non-functional. The user provided their GitHub Actions  workflow, confirming the deployment failure.

The engineer discovered that the  file's  had been reverted to a preview URL, breaking the local environment's connection to the local backend. Following insights from a , the engineer:
1.  **Corrected Local Environment**: Set   to  and   to  to restore local functionality.
2.  **Verified Production Environment File**: Confirmed that  was correctly configured for production deployment.
3.  **Debugged Backend Endpoints**: Investigated  and successfully tested  (the correct login endpoint) and , confirming that the local backend was fully functional and serving all content (Sections 3-5).
4.  **Diagnosed Deployment Issue**: Concluded that the  workflow was correct and the production deployment issue was most likely due to browser or CDN caching, not a problem with the code or the deployment process itself.
5.  **Provided Solution**: Created  to guide the user on clearing browser and CDN caches.

The current state is that the local development environment is fully operational and verified, displaying all updated content. The deployment issue is diagnosed as a client-side/caching problem, with the recommended solution provided to the user.

<optional_next_step>
Await user verification of the production deployment fix (caching) and then proceed with implementing format hints and progress tracking.
