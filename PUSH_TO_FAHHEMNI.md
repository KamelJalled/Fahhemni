4. Confirm all source files are present

### Deploy the Pre-built Files
**Frontend**: Deploy the `frontend/build/` folder to any static hosting:
- Netlify: Upload build folder
- Vercel: Import from GitHub, set publish directory to `frontend/build`
- GitHub Pages: Enable Pages, use `frontend/build` as source

**Backend**: Deploy backend folder as Python app:
- Railway/Render: Connect GitHub, deploy backend folder

3. **Environment Variables**: Update backend URL in hosting platform after backend deployment
4. **Database**: Set up MongoDB Atlas and configure connection string
